<h3>Leaning tower of Pisa</h3>

Is the leaning tower of Pisa really worth the visit? I believe so!
 The leaning tower of pisa seemed to have been such a big deal to me 
 as a child and growing up, I realized that it's not something everyone 
 gets to see in person in thier life time. It is located in Tuscany and 
 is quite a breath taking sight to see. Plus, it will be a cool photo 
 to post or show to friends and family! Sure, that may not be the most 
 common reason to go, but it is a reason if any! This tower is pretty 
 impressive with how long it has stayed standing.
